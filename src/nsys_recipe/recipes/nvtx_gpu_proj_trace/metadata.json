    "description": [
        "This recipe provides a trace of NVTX time ranges projected from the CPU onto",
        " the GPU. Each NVTX range contains one or more GPU operations. A GPU operation",
        " is considered to be 'contained' by an NVTX range if the CUDA API call used",
        " to launch the operation is within the NVTX range. Only ranges that start and",
        " end on the same thread are taken into account.\n\n",

        "The projected range will have the start timestamp of the first enclosed GPU",
        " operation and the end timestamp of the last enclosed GPU operation, as well",
        " as the stack state and relationship to other NVTX ranges."
