        "This recipe identifies time regions with low GPU utilization. For each",
        " process, each GPU device is examined, and a time range is created that starts",
        " with the beginning of the first GPU operation on that device and ends with the",
        " end of the last GPU operation on that device. This time range is then divided",
        " into equal chunks, and the GPU utilization is calculated for each chunk. The",
        " utilization includes all GPU operations as well as profiling overheads that the",
        " user cannot address.\n\n",

        "Note that the utilization refers to the 'time' utilization and not the",
        " 'resource' utilization. This script does not take into account how many GPU",
        " resources are being used. Therefore, a single running memcpy is considered the",
        " same amount of 'utilization' as a huge kernel that takes over all the cores.",
        " If multiple operations run concurrently in the same chunk, their utilization",
        " will be added up and may exceed 100%.\n\n",

        "Chunks with an in-use percentage less than the threshold value are displayed.",
        " If consecutive chunks have a low in-use percentage, the individual chunks are",
        " coalesced into a single display record, keeping the weighted average of",
        " percentages. This is why returned chunks may have different durations."
