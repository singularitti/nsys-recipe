        " the 'resource' utilization. All events are consolidated by taking the minimum",
        " start time and maximum end time for each group of overlapping ranges when",
        " multiple events run concurrently. The percentage is calculated based on the",
        " bin size and will be less than 100% unless events run or overlap throughout",
        " the entire duration of the bin."
